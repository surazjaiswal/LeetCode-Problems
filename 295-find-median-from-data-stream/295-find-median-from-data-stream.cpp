// to find median we need to have mid element for odd length and mid & mid+1 for even length
// in brute force we add new num and then sort them to get median takes (n^2 log n) time [TLE]
// here we see that we only need mid elements
// what if there is way to have to always get mid elements, and every insertion gets sorted to holds new mid elements required
// if we divide list in to two halfs
// for odd length   [5,3,4,2,6] => [5,3,4] [2,6]
// for even length  [5,3,4,2]   => [5,3] [4,2]
// and create max-heap for left half and min-heap right part
// considering max-heap will always contain 1 element more than min-heap
// the top of the max-heap will always hold the mid-th element, and top of min-heap always hold the (mid+1)th element
// after every intertion mid values will be updated as internal sorting in the heap 
// here intertion consists of many cases
// hence we got what we required
